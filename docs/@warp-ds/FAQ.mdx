# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I get IntelliSense for Warp Elements?

Install the [Web Components Language Server](https://wc-toolkit.com/integrations/web-components-language-server/) extension (available in several editors).

- [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wc-toolkit.web-components-language-server)
- [JetBrains products](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/29094-web-components-language-server)
- [VSCodium and other VSCode forks](https://open-vsx.org/extension/wc-toolkit/web-components-language-server)

The extension automatically picks up the [Custom Element Manifest](https://wc-toolkit.com/getting-started/) that we ship with `@warp-ds/elements`.

## Why are inputs and buttons not clickable in my modal or drawer component?

If you use a [focus trap](https://css-tricks.com/a-primer-on-focus-trapping/), or you use a dependency that does, that focus trap might need extra configuration to work with custom elements.

For example, the [focus-trap module](https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap#shadow-dom) used by [react-spring-bottom-sheet](https://github.com/stipsan/react-spring-bottom-sheet) will not work with custom elements by default. It thinks clicks inside a custom element is outside of the focus trap, and so cancels the click.

If you run into this problem in a dependency, either work with the maintainer to fix the problem, replace the dependency, patch it locally, or fork it to add support.

```js
const fallback = fallbackRef.current
const trap = createFocusTrap(targetRef.current, {
  // tabbableOptions.getShadowRoot is required in `focus-trap` when using custom elements
  tabbableOptions: {
    getShadowRoot: true,
  },
  initialFocus: initialFocusRef
    ? () => initialFocusRef?.current || fallback
    : undefined,
  fallbackFocus: fallback,
  escapeDeactivates: false,
  clickOutsideDeactivates: false,
})
```
