# @warp-ds/elements

The home of Warp components for web. Can be used in plain HTML pages or your framework of choice.

## Usage

### Install

Warp Elements are published to and delivered by our CDN server, Eik. You do not need to install `@warp-ds/elements` to use the components, and you should not bundle the components into your client-side application code.

If you want better DX (types, intellisense, and docs in editors), you can install `@warp-ds/elements` locally and use it alongside the Web Components Language Server extension for VS Code.

_npm_:

```sh
npm install @warp-ds/elements
```

_pnpm_:
```sh
pnpm add @warp-ds/elements
```

#### Using @borealis

If you are on a recent version of `@borealis`, you already have the latest version of Warp loaded optimally on your pages. No extra setup is required.

#### Without @borealis (load from Eik)

Add the Warp script and stylesheet to the document head so it loads early:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://assets.finn.no/pkg/@warp-ds/elements/~2/styles.css" crossorigin />
<script type="module" src="https://assets.finn.no/pkg/@warp-ds/elements/~2/index.js" crossorigin></script>
```

### Avoid FOUC with Warp cloaking

To avoid flash-of-unstyled-content and cumulative layout shift issues, wrap your page content in a `warp-cloak` container. The cloak is removed automatically once Warp is ready.

```html
<div class="warp-cloak">
  <main>
    <!-- Your app -->
  </main>
</div>
```

### Toast API (the only bundling exception)

Warp components should never be bundled into client-side application code. The only exception is the toast APIs, which are not included automatically on pages.

You can either bundle them:

```ts
import { toast, removeToast, updateToast } from '@warp-ds/elements/packages/toast';
```

Or load them directly from Eik:

```ts
import { toast, removeToast, updateToast } from "https://assets.finn.no/pkg/@warp-ds/elements/~2/packages/toast/index.js";
```

### Use the components in your markup

Once the components have been imported you can use them in your HTML.

```html
<w-breadcrumbs class="mt-10">
  <a href="#/url/1">Eiendom</a>
  <a href="#/url/2">Bolig til salgs</a>
  <a href="#/url/3" aria-current="page"> Oslo </a>
</w-breadcrumbs>
```

Check the sidebar to see available components in interactive demos. The demos include code examples (click Show code).

### React (v19+)

React 19+ supports custom elements directly. Make sure the Warp assets are loaded in the document head, then use the elements in JSX.

```tsx
export function Example() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    toast({ title: 'Saved', description: 'Your changes are live.' });
  };

  return (
    <section>
      <w-badge variant="neutral">New</w-badge>
      <w-button variant="primary" onClick={handleClick}>
        Continue
      </w-button>
    </section>
  );
}
```

Any event that the component emits, can be used in React by prefixing it with "on". 

## Editor integration

### Visual Studio Code


Install the [Web Components Language Server](https://wc-toolkit.com/integrations/web-components-language-server/) extension.

The extension automatically picks up the [Custom Element Manifest](https://wc-toolkit.com/getting-started/) that we ship with `@warp-ds/elements`.

### JetBrains products

We ship `web-types.json` which should get picked up automatically by JetBrains IDEA and similar products.

You should see code completions and inline docs for Warp elements when writing HTML.
