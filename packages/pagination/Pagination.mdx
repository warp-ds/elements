# Pagination

Pagination allows users to navigate through multiple pages of content by providing navigation controls with page numbers and directional arrows.

## Events

- `page-click` - Triggered when a link button in the pagination is clicked. Contains the page number in `string` form.

## Usage guidelines

**When to use:** Use pagination when you have a large dataset that needs to be split across multiple pages to improve performance and user experience.

**Page numbering:** The component uses 1-indexed page numbers (first page is 1, not 0).

**URL structure:** The `base-url` prop should include the URL pattern up to where the page number will be appended. For example, if your URLs are `/search?page=1`, set `base-url="/search?page="`.

## Accessibility

The pagination component includes proper ARIA labels and semantic navigation structure:

- Uses nav element with "Pages" heading for screen readers
- Current page is marked with `aria-current="page"`
- Navigation buttons include descriptive screen reader text
- All interactive elements meet minimum touch target size requirements (44px)
- Keyboard navigation is fully supported
