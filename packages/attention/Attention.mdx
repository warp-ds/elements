## Accessibility
If the Attention element has "left" or "top" position, it should be placed before the target element in the DOM.

Attention element handles accessibility automatically by wrapping its slotted content with a `div` with either `role="tooltip"` for tooltip or `role="img"` for callout and popover, a default `aria-label` and setting an `aria-details` attribute on the target element. The default `aria-label` also supports i18n.

It is possible to tell assistive technologies to recognize only a part of Attention's text content. To do that set the role attribute on the relevant text element nested in w-attention and reference it by id through the use of aria-details. The aria-details attribute is on the target element, not on w-attention.
