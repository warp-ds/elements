# Expandable

Expandable is a layout component used for creating expandable content areas on a page.

<Canvas of={ExpandableStories.Default} />

## Visual options

### Start expanded

<Canvas of={ExpandableStories.Expanded} />

### With or without animation

By default the box expands immediately, but you can animate it.

<Canvas of={ExpandableStories.Box} />
<Canvas of={ExpandableStories.Animated} />

### With a heading wrapping the toggle button

This can be used to wrap the toggle button in a heading for navigational and structural purposes. It's a feature that is needed typically in scenarios where multiple consecutive Expandable components are used.

<Canvas of={ExpandableStories.WithHeading} />

### With custom title

This can be used if more control over styling is needed than the title prop allows

<Canvas of={ExpandableStories.CustomTitle} />

### Without a title

This can be used if more control over styling is needed than the title prop allows

<Canvas of={ExpandableStories.NoTitle} />

### Without chevron icon

<Canvas of={ExpandableStories.NoChevron} />
