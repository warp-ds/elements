# Toast

Toast is a bit different from other packages in Warp Elements. You need to import functions from the package and call them as needed.

The toast is intended to be used programmatically. JavaScript APIs are provided to create, update and remove toasts from a page while managing things like placement on the page for you.

## Import functions for working with toasts

Be sure to import the elements package first as the toast APIs depend on this package.

```js
import from '@warp-ds/elements/components/toast';
```

Once you have imported the elements package, import the toast api package.

```js
import { toast, removeToast, updateToast } from '@warp-ds/elements/toast';
```

<Canvas of={ToastStories.Default} />
