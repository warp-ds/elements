# Dead toggle

Dead toggle can be used where the appearance of a checkbox or radio is needed - but for accessibility purposes an actual input element should not be present.

Typically this happens in a component like a Card, where the whole card should behave as a checkbox and be clickable - but the representation of a checkbox-UI is part of the card

[For examples see the Warp Card documentation](https://warp-ds.github.io/docs/components/card/).
