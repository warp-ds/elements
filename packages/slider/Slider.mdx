# Sliders

Sliders allow users to adjust a numeric value within a given continuous range.

A slider provides a visual indication of an adjustable value within a defined range (minimum and maximum values) by moving a handle along a horizontal track.

## Variants

Sliders come in two variants:

- Single (default)
- Range

## Single slider

Single sliders allow users to select a single value within the slider track.

## Range slider

Range sliders allow users to define minimum and maximum values from a predefined range within the slider track.

<Canvas of={SliderStories.Range} />

## Examples

These examples show the range slider, but the single slider has the same options.

### Suffixes

Sliders can define a suffix that will be added to the labels and input fields.

<Canvas of={SliderStories.SuffixCurrency} />
<Canvas of={SliderStories.SuffixKilometers} />


### Tick marks

The sliders can have tick marks shown at selected intervals below the slider track.

### Slider with over and under max values

Sliders can be configured so that the minimum and maximum values are empty.

You can use that as a signal to treat the value as not set, for example if you want to have a selection for "Before 1950" to "After 2025" or "Over 200 000 km".

### Error state

With the input fields a user might input values that are outside the allowed minimum and maximum values, or where the from value is higher than the to value in range sliders. In these cases the input field gets highlighted with the error color and a validation error message is shown below it.
